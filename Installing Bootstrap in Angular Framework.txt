Using CDN Network:

In order to include Bootstrap styles in Angular framework, we can directly include the link and the script from the Bootstrap website in the <link> and <script> tag respectively. 
This is the  first process of using CDN Network where we take the CDN URL of styles and scripts and link them in the HTML files. 

Using NPM Package Manager:

# Step1)
    For Bootstrap 4:
      npm install bootstrap jquery popper --save
                 OR
      npm i bootstrap jquery popper --save 
     
    For Bootstrap 5:
      npm i bootstrap popper --save

# Step2) 
      Update the styles and scripts in Angular.json

Note that we use --save because we want to apply the package in the local module, not the global.

For updating the styles and scripts, follow:
